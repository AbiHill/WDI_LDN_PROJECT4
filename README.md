# GA WDI-32 Project 4 - Rec Head

For my final project, I was required to build a full-stack application using an express API to serve data from a Mongo database.

As I play a lot of basketball in my spare time and I try to organise recreational matches at local basketball courts around London and sometimes it can be tricky to find a location and organise the teams. So I thought it would be a good idea to create my own sports recreational meet up app called Rec Head.

Rec Head allows users to create their own sports events and join others. I've integrated Google Maps API and Google Address Auto Complete to make it easy for the event organise to display the location of the sports event.

A highlight of this project was integrating Twilio which is a CRM tool to send automated text messages when a user has successfully joined an event.

To improve the app further I'm keen to include a feature that allows users to message each other and also develop the events page further to showcase a calendar of events and improve the usability.

In order to run the app:
* Run Yarn
* yarn start:client
* yarn start:server
