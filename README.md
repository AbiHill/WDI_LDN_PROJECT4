# GA WDI-32 Project 4 - MERN Full Stack App - Rec Head

For my final project, I was required to build a full-stack application using an express API to serve data from a Mongo database, and utilising React.

I play a lot of basketball in my spare time and I try to organise recreational matches at local basketball courts around London. With it sometimes being difficult to organise the teams I thought it would be a good idea to create my own sports recreational meet up app called Rec Head.

Rec Head allows users to create their own sports events and join others' events. I've integrated Google Maps API and Google Address Auto Complete to make it easy for the event organiser to display the location of the sports event.

A highlight of this project was integrating Twilio which is a CRM tool to send automated text messages when a user has successfully joined an event.

Users are required to register and log in in order to join events.

It's also possible for the user to filter through the events to find which type of event they are looking for.

I worked hard on making sure the styling was sleek and consistent throughout the full website to keep the branding aligned.

Another highlight of the project was also including FileStack which is a great tool for users to be able to upload images easily from their computers or social media accounts.

Users are able to view their profile which displays what events they are attending. User's are also able to see who are attending certain events.

To improve the app further I'm keen to include a feature that allows users to message each other and also develop the events page further to showcase a calendar of events and improve the usability.

In order to run the app:
* Run Yarn
* yarn start:client
* yarn start:server
